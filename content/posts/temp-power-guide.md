*TL;DR?* Skip to the ["TPP Quick Checklist"](#checklist) section at the end for a condensed list of steps.

## Understanding the Players

There are three main entities involved in setting up temporary power:

1. **Temporary Power Pole Company**: Installs the physical power pole with electrical panel and outlets
2. **Southern California Edison (SCE)**: The utility company that connects electrical service to the pole
3. **Local Building & Safety Department**: Inspects and approves the installation (LA County for unincorporated areas)

## Cost Overview (As of 2025)

Expect to pay for:
* Power pole installation: $700-800 (one-time fee)
* SCE connection fee: Approximately $437 (one-time fee)
* Monthly pole rental: $50-60 per month
* Monthly electricity usage: Varies based on consumption

## Key Process Overview

### Initial Setup
Contact SCE to create a service request and get a commercial account number. An SCE planner from Monrovia will determine the pole location. Get quotes from several temporary power pole companies (like A-Co Temporary Power at 818-255-3560, but shop around for competitive offers). Complete SCE paperwork, arrange payment, and schedule installation.

### Installation and Inspection
Once the pole is installed, schedule an inspection with LA County. After passing inspection, notify SCE so they can connect power, which typically takes 2-8 weeks.

### Important Notes
- Always mention you're an Eaton Fire victim in all communications
- The Monrovia Planning Office (626-303-8489) often routes to voicemail; be persistent
- Ask about the current process for submitting forms, as email addresses may change
- Having both 110V and 220V outlets is essential for most construction needs

Keep documentation of all communications, payments, and approvals throughout the process.

## Important Documentation for SCE Process

Keep copies of these essential documents:
* SCE Service Request Number
* Commercial Account Number
* SCE Invoice and payment confirmation
* Completed DS-111 form
* Completed CSD-274 form
* Power pole company invoice and contract
* Building inspection approval

## SCE-Specific Tips for Eaton Fire Victims

* **Set Clear Expectations**: The entire process typically takes 6-10 weeks from application to energized service with SCE
* **Mention Eaton Fire**: Always mention you are an Eaton Fire victim in all communications
* **Regular Follow-ups**: If you don't hear from an SCE planner within 7 days of creating your service request, call 1-800-655-4555
* **Monrovia Planning Office**: Be persistent with the Monrovia office (626-303-8489) if your planner is hard to reach
* **Documentation**: Send all communications to SCE via email when possible to maintain a paper trail
* **Mutual Support**: Stay in contact with other Eaton Fire victims to share experiences and tips

## Common Issues with SCE Temporary Power

* **Delayed Response**: SCE planners handle many requests - follow up weekly if you don't receive a response
* **Missing Information**: Incomplete DS-111 or CSD-274 forms will delay your application
* **Location Disputes**: If you disagree with the SCE planner's pole location recommendation, address this early
* **Billing Confusion**: Temporary power is billed as a commercial account - contact SCE Commercial Services for billing questions
