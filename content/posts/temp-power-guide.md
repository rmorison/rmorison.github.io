*TL;DR?* Skip to the ["TPP Quick Checklist"](#checklist) section at the end for a condensed list of steps.

## Understanding the Players

There are four main entities involved in setting up temporary power:

1. **Temporary Power Pole Company**: Installs the physical power pole with electrical panel and outlets
2. **Southern California Edison (SCE)**: The utility company that connects electrical service to the pole
3. **LA County Public Works/Building & Safety**: Issues permits and inspects the installation
4. **You as Owner-Builder**: Responsible for permit applications and coordinating the process

## Cost Overview (As of 2025)

Expect to pay for:
* Power pole installation: $500-800 (one-time fee)
* SCE connection fee: Approximately $437 (one-time fee)
* LA County permit fee: Varies (typically $100-300)
* Monthly pole rental: $50-60 per month
* Monthly electricity usage: Varies based on consumption

## Key Process Overview

### Initial Setup
Contact SCE to create a service request and get a commercial account number. An SCE planner from Monrovia will determine the pole location. Apply for a permit through LA County Public Works EPIC LA portal as an Owner-Builder. Get quotes from several temporary power pole companies (like A-Co Temporary Power at 818-255-3560, but shop around for competitive offers). Complete SCE paperwork, arrange payment, and schedule installation.

### Installation and Inspection
Once the pole is installed, schedule an inspection with LA County. After passing inspection, notify SCE so they can connect power, which typically takes 2-8 weeks.

### Important Notes
- Always mention you're an Eaton Fire victim in all communications
- The Monrovia Planning Office (626-303-8489) often routes to voicemail; be persistent
- Ask about the current process for submitting forms, as email addresses may change
- Having both 110V and 220V outlets is essential for most construction needs

Keep documentation of all communications, payments, and approvals throughout the process.

## LA County Permit Application Process

**This step is mandatory and a good place to start:**

1. **Apply online at [EPIC LA Portal](https://epicla.lacounty.gov/)**
   * Create an account if you don't already have one
   * Select "Apply for Permit" and choose "Electrical" category
   * Apply as "Owner-Builder" (important for fire victims)
   * Clearly state your immediate project need (e.g., "Temporary power for pool cleanup, repair and maintenance following Eaton Fire damage")
   * Include your parcel number and property information

2. **Complete the Owner Builder Declaration Form**
   * You'll be contacted by a permit technician to complete this required form
   * For the Owner Builder Declaration section:
     * Check the second option if you're exclusively hiring licensed contractors to do the work (most common for temporary power poles)
     * Check the acknowledgment box regarding selling owner-built structures (required)
   * For the Workers Compensation Declaration:
     * Check the third box if you won't be employing workers directly
   * For Hazardous Material Declaration:
     * Answer "No" to both questions (temporary power poles don't typically involve hazardous materials)
   * For Asbestos Notification:
     * Check the box declaring asbestos removal is not applicable to your project
   * Sign and date all required sections
   * This form certifies you understand your responsibilities as an Owner-Builder

3. **Provide Required Documentation**
   * Site plan showing proposed pole location
   * Any additional documentation requested by the permit technician

4. **Respond to Requests Promptly**
   * A permit technician may contact you for additional information
   * Respond quickly to avoid delays
   * Keep all email communications for your records

5. **Pay Permit Fees**
   * Fees can be paid online through the EPIC LA portal
   * Keep receipt for your records

**Eaton Fire Fast Track Permit Office:**
* Location: 464 W Woodbury Rd, Altadena
* Phone: 626-424-6743
* This special permit office was established to assist Eaton Fire victims
* Available to answer questions and check permit status
* We don't know how long this office will remain available, so call before visiting

**Note:** You must obtain this permit before requesting inspection. The approved inspection is required for SCE to energize your temporary power pole.

## Important Documentation for SCE Process

Keep copies of these essential documents:
* LA County permit and receipt
* SCE Service Request Number
* Commercial Account Number
* SCE Invoice and payment confirmation
* Completed DS-111 form
* Completed CSD-274 form
* Power pole company invoice and contract
* Building inspection approval

## SCE Payment Information

SCE currently requires payment of their invoice by either:
* Wire transfer (follow instructions on invoice)
* Mailed paper check to the address specified on the invoice

Online payment options are not currently available for temporary power connections. Allow extra time for payment processing.

## SCE-Specific Tips for Eaton Fire Victims

* **Set Clear Expectations**: The entire process typically takes 6-10 weeks from application to energized service with SCE
* **Mention Eaton Fire**: Always mention you are an Eaton Fire victim in all communications
* **Regular Follow-ups**: If you don't hear from an SCE planner within 7 days of creating your service request, call 1-800-655-4555
* **Monrovia Planning Office**: Be persistent with the Monrovia office (626-303-8489) if your planner is hard to reach
* **Documentation**: Send all communications to SCE via email when possible to maintain a paper trail
* **Mutual Support**: Stay in contact with other Eaton Fire victims to share experiences and tips

## Common Issues with SCE Temporary Power

* **Delayed Response**: SCE planners handle many requests - follow up weekly if you don't receive a response
* **Missing Information**: Incomplete DS-111 or CSD-274 forms will delay your application
* **Location Disputes**: If you disagree with the SCE planner's pole location recommendation, address this early
* **Billing Confusion**: Temporary power is billed as a commercial account - contact SCE Commercial Services for billing questions
* **Permit Issues**: Failing to obtain proper LA County permits will delay the entire process
